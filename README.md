# FatalSafe

An elegant way to save yourself from accidentally locking out when you're struck by **Fatal Errors** while editing a live WordPress theme or a plugin.  **FatalSafe** will switch to any theme in the default twenty series (i.e twentyfifteen), or deactivate the problematic plugin and gives you a chance to fix your error by keeping your site live.

Just remember to activate **FatalSafe** before starting your **dirty** live theme or plugin edit task.
